## Workflow

I used Pyhton to connect to Kaggle and to upload the data into a MySQL database.
In MySQL Workbench I created severeal VIEWs that were queried in pyhton in order to create the visualisations (Multitable-Ecommerce-European-Fashion.sql).
The Constrains (Primary Keys, Foreign Keys) in the Database were created with the File "CONSTRAINTS.sql"

## Goal: Evaluate the last sales campaign and plan the next campaign
I evaluated the old campaign by comparing the profit with and without the discounts in May and by displaying the running total of items sold. 
The previous sales campaign seemed to have no impact on the sales

I used Pyhton to connect to Kaggle and to upload the data into a mySQL database.
In MySQL Workbench I created severeal VIEWs that were queried in pyhton in order to create the visualisations.

## Goal: Evaluate the last sales campaign and plan the next campaign
I evaluated the old campaign by comparing the profit with and without the discounts in May and by displaying the running total of items sold. 
The previous sales campaign seemed to have no impact on the sales

To determine which items should be included in the sale I created a stock reach metric - i.e. how many months would the current stock last with the average sales, I combined this with the margin as well.
